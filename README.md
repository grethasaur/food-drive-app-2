This was a plan B in case the original doesn't deploy because we were having dependancy issues 24 hours before presentation but thank goodness plan A deployed on streamlit 30 minutes before showtime. There were minor issues like predict button doesnt work there but at least it successfully deployed and the buttons can be fixed later on if needed.
